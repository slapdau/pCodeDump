	   The main reason for doing this is that the directory entry objects need to be able to write
	   block ranges for linkage information, but these block ranges are inferred from the gaps
	   between the end of code in one segment and the start of the next segment.  Directory entries
	   are self contained and don't refer to each other.  So the inferred endings for each segment
	   are calculated and passed to directory entry constructors.

	   Data blocks use 0 as a special value for the segment end. Segment block ranges are treated
	   as [begin, end), so the block number returned is actually one block past the end block of
	   the segment.  For the last segment in a file, this block number be past the end of the file. */
